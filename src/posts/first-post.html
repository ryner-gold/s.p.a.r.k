  <h1>My First Post - Tutorial Hell</h1>
  <div class="fancy-box">
    <p>
      As someone who considers myself new to these parts of town, I feel like my first post
      being about tutorial hell feels about right.
    </p>

      My story of tutorial hell goes something like this. It starts with FreeCodeCamp, finishing a
      couple sections, copy-along JS tutorials, then getting into an 18 month apprenticeship with
      Multiverse where you'd think things might change but the tutorial hell was simply served to
      me in the form of bootcamps (~3 months).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      After hopping around from backend to the app squad, thanks to an amazing manager and his
      support in the app
      team, I then
      found myself receiving a job offer! At this point, I was truly thinking okay I'm an
      engineer now right? The tutorial hell is over, right?... Far from it. ðŸ« 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Making my grand return to our backend, I found myself facing a cliffside. Aptly named
      "Reactive Programming", "Functional Programming", "Spring Webflux", "Spring Boot",
      "Microservices", "Test
      Driven
      Development". The fundamental
      Java tech stack itself wasn't difficult, rather the concepts driving them were incredibly
      intimidating.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I found myself caught between a rock and a hard place. I knew I <b>had</b> to learn these
      concepts whilst on the other hand I <b>had</b> to complete tickets and contribute to work.
      I choose the latter. Then I found myself in a precarious position 16 months later.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I could complete tickets, sometimes with or without the assistance of AI. Yet, I had never
      picked up a book, an article or frequently watched videos. Don't get me wrong, I'd read a
      Stack Overflow post, a Reddit thread, or anything related to the problem I need to solve
      for my ticket every day until the sun goes down but I was missing the critical bit of
      actually laying out solid foundations.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      It can definitely be said that there may be room for me to be accountable and try to find
      the time to do those things whilst working but with my non-existent background in
      education, and a more non-existent upbringing, learning a workflow in and of itself was missing.
      Meta learning as they like to call it these days.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>On that note, that was my realisation to escape tutorial hell. Ahah! Eureka!</p>

      I just had to remind myself, I don't know how to think! I don't know how to learn well!
      On a regular day, this would've been saddening to tell myself but now I saw it as a non
      personal statement. After all, I didn't know a single thing about programming, much less
      design
      patterns, programming paradigms, and Primeagen 4 years ago so why do I constantly subject
      myself to a pitcher fork of "Why don't you understand this?"
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>By realising I didn't have these background experiences, I could finally focus on trying
      to understand that I have to cultivate the attitude and mindset that can pair with the
      technical aptitude that I had for technology. I don't believe in the idea that a person is
      born for a role or more suited. What I believe in is that people can mould themselves, and
      are always open to growth as long as they let themselves believe that's an option.
      Knowledge is a gift free to all.</p>

      Nowadays you'll find me struggling to balance time between HyperSkill courses on Java, Tim
      Bulchalka's section on advanced topics in his complete Java developer course, work, reading
      material and reflections. In these reflections, I remind myself that there's more to
      learning than just hard work, there's the filling in the gaps to have an academic approach,
      a resilient attitude towards learning (which is starkly different to physical training),
      and compassion to myself for making mistakes!
