    Hello there! Here's my life story, I hope you have some popcorn.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I was born in Nepal, where I grew up without my parents. At a certain point in my childhood
    (10-11), my parents came to pick me up and take me to the UK. This was the 2nd most difficult
    chapter of my life. My parents were unfortunately abusive, physically and verbally. They both
    abused themselves with substances as well. You can imagine what this does to a child.
  </p>

  <p>
    I say it's the 2nd most difficult chapter of my life because living independently was far, far
    more difficult. When you're not raised with the toolset to deal with emotions, lack knowledge
    in important areas like finance, you tend to make some grave mistakes. I had found myself
    following the footsteps of my parents, regularly resorting to alcohol to cope, sabotaging my
    relationships, both friends and romantic.

    Every month since I was 17, which is when I left after dropping out of school, I would
    constantly apply for jobs -
    typically customer service because I knew I had to learn how to talk to people before I
    could achieve anything in my lifetime. During this time, my desire to get into a tech role
    continued to grow. I had always been deeply passionate about the idea of figuring out how
    things work, especially code. When I was 11, I played a FPS game, Crossfire, where I was
    introduced to the concept of glitches. Also around then, a browser game AdventureQuest
    where I learned about the infamous Cheat Engine.

    As a child, it just left me astounded. It was like magic, no, it was magic to me. It was
    better than a magic trick - what do you mean I can jump on the corner of a box, move left and
    right and I'd noclip out of bounds in the map? This led me as a child to see it as this war
    between creators and hackers. It planted a seed that led me to where I am today. What
    are both of them using and who created it? Code. What is code?

    At 24, I was working as a Security Officer at Heathrow, using my breaks to learn how to code.
    Then I found myself lucky enough to secure an apprenticeship (UK) and at 26, an Associate
    Software Engineer. I'm now closer than I ever could be with that question child me had: what
    is code? Nowadays, I moreso think about what goes on in the mind of those that create amazing
    technologies that shape the world, and even more so the minds of those who create programming
    languages, debuggers, code analysis tools, game-changing frameworks, and so on. I'm fairly
    sure I just want to be a scientist with coding. To me, it honestly is just like imagination -
    there is only one real limit and that is creativity.
